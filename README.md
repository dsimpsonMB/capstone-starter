## How to use Live Share to collaborate with your teammates on this project

Live Share is a VS Code Extension that is preinstalled in your codespace. It allows you to create a link that will anyone who has it to make changes to your codespace. This is how you will be able to work on this project as a group at the same time.

To keep things simple at first we will be creating **one** codespace for each group that someone in your group will be the owner of and will be under that person's account to make live collaboration easier. This means that only that **one** person will have full access to this codespace and you will have to coordinate if someone else who is **not the owner** wants to work on the project outside of class.

If during the course of working the project you plan on working on the project extensively outside of class and this will be an obstacle please let us know during class time so we can help you with best practices when managing multiple people working asynchronously on the project outside of class.

### How to start a Live Share session

1. Click the Live Share button highlighted below in blue. It will be along the very bottom of the left side of the screen

   **Do not click the green button**, this will make your teammates unable to edit the code in the project.

   If the link isn't in your clipboard, you don't see this popup or you need to copy the invite link again, you can get the link by clicking the _"Shared"_ button that has taken the place of the Live Share button shown in step 1 and clicking the first option in the popup (_"Invite others (copy link)_".)

4. Once your teammate(s) have clicked that link, you will need to accept their request to join the session
